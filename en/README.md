:::: warning Announcement: Bad news
> Due to [Unity's pricing policy](https://unity.com/cn/pricing-updates)Adjustment, RF developers are making every effort to work on the official 1.0 game version of non Early Access, striving to cancel their Unity developer license before the new policy takes effect.
>
> If there are no changes to the plan, this will mean:
> - Part of the original plan may be cut off
> - The game may not provide long-term support (it is not ruled out to create RF sequels on another engine)

Therefore, this document may permanently cease maintenance at a future time point (approximately two years after the game is stopped)

I'm very sorry

But there's no way, if the creative workshops for future games gradually fade away, I think this can only be a useless effort
