# Weapon
## Description

The base class of a weapon, which is the basis for constructing a weapon

## Usage

Applied to the topmost level of the weapon object, with subsidiary objects hanging down inside this object

Refer [RFCreator Project](/cn/Tutorials/wpn.1.md)

## Comment

This component uses an Audio Source component as a dependency, please place the fire sound in this component (check the `Loop` for Audio Source if it is an automatic weapon, and be careful not to check `Play on Awake`!)

In addition, please avoid having multiple Audio Source components side by side on an object with a Weapon component on it, as this will result in sound clashes and gameplay errors!

The solution is to create a new empty object inside the weapon and mount another Audio Source on it.
